Load Balancing for Peak Energy Consumption


INTRODUCTION
 
The "Energy Balance" application aims to optimize energy consumption by shifting peak energy usage to off-peak hours. This application leverages machine learning to analyze energy consumption patterns, forecast demand, and suggest load balancing strategies to users.
 
PROPOSED SYSTEM
Here we implement the machine learning and visualization part of the system using  24 hours energy consumption dataset.
